This script (training_data_deficit_calculator_v1.0.R) calculates the area-weighted reference site deficit for each preclear RE1 from v14, accounting for analogous, replacement and combined REs

# 1) Workspace setup: creates the project directory structure, loads required libraries and imports data and dependancies
# 2) Data processing: processes raw tabular and spatial data from Regional Ecosystem mapping and combines with Spatial BioCondition training data and dependancies
# 3) Deficit calculator: calculates preclear area-weighted reference site deficits, accounts for statistically and expert-ellicited analogous REs, and applies a simple bioregional prioritisation algorithm to faciliate fieldwork planning
